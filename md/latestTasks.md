# App.css

# Navbar

- [x] Create Responsive Navbar.
- [ ] When user scrolls down one time and then back up, the height readjusts itself twice because the className is changed twice.

# Hero Section

[.] Last thing I did was try to adjust the widths of the inner section containers. For some reasont he hero container is going out of the viewport. There is padding on the `main` element but why is this happening?
