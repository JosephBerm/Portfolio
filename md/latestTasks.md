# App.css

# Navbar

- [x] Create Responsive Navbar.
- [ ] When user scrolls down one time and then back up, the height readjusts itself twice because the className is changed twice.

# Project Details

[.] I have an issue where the middle project item isn't aligning properly. I know this because I remove the project details element and the picture moves. It's supposed to stick to the right of the grid.
