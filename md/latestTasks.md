# App.css

[.] In section observer, I changed it to be more dynamic and all I have to do is to pass a threshold map that will contain the threshold for each element being observed. Change the name of the variables so it doesn't say section but element. Also go to navbar and rename the observer to just being observer and not section observer.

# Navbar

- [x] Create Responsive Navbar.
- [ ] When user scrolls down one time and then back up, the height readjusts itself twice because the className is changed twice.

# Background

[.] I left off styling the stars that don't appear when the screen is wider than 2000px.
