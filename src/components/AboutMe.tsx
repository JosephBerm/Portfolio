					<p>
						Hi, I&apos;m Joseph, and I&apos;m passionate about the Internet of Things. My path to becoming a
						software engineer began in the summer of 2013, when I worked alongside my father doing
						maintenance at an office building. It was there that I met someone who completely changed how I
						saw the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						During our conversations, I saw firsthand how an idea could evolve from a simple concept into
						something tangible and impactful. Watching him turn lines of code into a working product sparked
						my curiosity and creativityâ€”it was the moment I realized the power of technology to bring ideas
						to life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, I&apos;m driven by that same curiosity. I aim to build solutions from the ground up,
						combining innovation with functionality to make a meaningful impact. My goal is to stay at the
						forefront of cutting-edge technology and contribute to creating digital experiences that truly
						make a difference.
					</p>
					<p>Here are a few technologies I&apos;ve been working with recently:</p>
					<ul className='skills_list sfx'>
						<li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
						<li>Node.js</li>
						<li>React</li>
						<li>.NET Core</li>

						<li>Vue.js</li>
					</ul>
